# SQS Populate

This is service to populate queues in AWS SQS, parsing data and making your job smooth.

## Why was created?

I have some services running in AWS Lambda that have SQS dependencies, and I all my project that I need to use it I write validation data again in each one, this don't make sense. So, SQS Populate was created.
